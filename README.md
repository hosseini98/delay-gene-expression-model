## Fixed and distributed delays from a family of gene transcription models 

The first crucial step in gene expression is the transcription of the DNA to  RNA. It can be considered as a movement of a complex machine, an RNA polymerase, on a one-dimensional template strand. 
In this work, the spatio-temporal organization of one RNA polymerase (RNAP) along a DNA strand is explored by studying a kinetic stochastic model for transcription process, the first step in gene expression. An explicit expression for the probability density of one RNAP was found and compared with stochastic simulation results  from the corresponding detailed stochastic model. The explicit solution predicts that the movement of RNAP in large genes (genes of a few hundred nucleotides or more) is advective. It provides a justification for the use of delays in gene expression modeling, especially in delay-stochastic models.
